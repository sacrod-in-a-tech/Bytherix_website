              Three years ago, they started with something very simple. At first, the goal was not to change the world. Honestly, they just wanted to make money and build something of their own. Like everyone else, they were also told to get a good job, build a career, and aim for something "better than their level." But they had each other.

              It all started with simple conversations at a tea stall. They would sit together, drink tea, and talk about technology, upcoming hackathons, ideas, and all the things they wanted to build. They didn't have a proper office. They didn't have investors. They didn't have a business plan. They just had ideas.
